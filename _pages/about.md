I am a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Economics at Yale University. I focus on topics in Labor Economics and Household Finance. 

I have an MA in Economics from Yale University. I graduated summa cum laude with BA in Economics-Mathematics from Columbia University. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Research Professional at Chicago Booth and as Academic Fellow at the JP Morgan Chase Institute. 

Please do not hesitate to reach out to talk about economics, grad school or anything else!
